> We've already released 4.19.3 because 4.19.0 had some severe bugs. Please use this version instead.

Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git centric software development platform [GitBucket 4.19.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.19.0)!

## Maven repository plugin

[gitbucket-maven-repository-plugin](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket-maven-repository-plugin) which makes possible to host maven repositories on GitBucket is available for GitBucket 4.19.0.

Following Maven repositories become available by installing this plugin to GitBucket.

- `http(s)://GITBUCKET_HOST/maven/releases`
- `http(s)://GITBUCKET_HOST/maven/snapshots`

You can deploy your artifacts to these repositories via WebDAV or SCP. See details about this plugin and configuration at the plugin's [README](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket-maven-repository-plugin/blob/master/README.md).

## Upgrade to Scalatra 2.6

[Scalatra](http://scalatra.org/) is a servlet based web framework for Scala and GitBucket uses it. The latest major update of Scalatra, 2.6 was released November, so we moved to Scalatra 2.6 series in GitBucket 4.19.0.

One of big topics in Scalatra 2.6 is GitBucket's [scalatra-forms](https://github.com/gitbucket/scalatra-forms) was merged to Scalatra. GitBucket codebase was modified to use Scalatra's version of scalatra-forms in this release. This might break binary compatibility of existing GitBucket plugins. If you can find broken plugins, let know plugin authors to that.

Also Scala, sbt and JGit has been upgraded in thie release, and drop joda-time dependency.

## Improve layout of the system settings page

The layout of the system setting page has been improved. A major change is in the skin selector. It was moved just below "Information" section, and now you can confirm the presentation of a selected skin before saving settings.

## New extension point

New extension point `sshCommandProvider` has been added. Plugins can handle SSH communication using this extension point. In fact, gitbucket-maven-repository-plugin uses this extension point to handle uploading artifacts via SCP.

In addition, [gitbucket-pages-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-pages-plugin) has been dropped from bundled plugins temporary because we couldn't complete update for Scalatra 2.6 before this release. It will be bundled again after update is completed. Also this release contains some improvements and bug fix. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.19.0) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
