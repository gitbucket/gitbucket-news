You can run GitBucket using `docker` command immediately:

```

You can also specify the data directory by `-v` option:

```

## Confirm dialog for dangerous operations

Before this release, GitBucket shown a confirmation dialog for only repository deletion. Now it shows for also "Transfer Ownership" and "Garbage collection" for further safety.
