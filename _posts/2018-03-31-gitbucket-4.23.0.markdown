Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git centric software development platform [GitBucket 4.23.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.23.0)!

## Fix handling for tail slash in URL

Tail slash in url has been allowed in all paths. For example, GitBucket makes same behavior for both `/owner/repos` and `/owner/repos/`. In particular, this fix improves integration with other products such as Jenkins.

Note for plugin developers: If you plugin has a actions which end with slash, you have to remove them because tail slash is no longer necessary

## Display commit message of tags at the releases page

Commit messages of each tag have been displayed at the releases page. Also they are used as the default value of the release description when you are going to create a new release.

## Enhance issue and pull request API response

Added `labels` property to the response of issues and pull requests API.

```javascript
[
  {
    "number": 1,
    "state": "open",
    ...
    "labels": [
      {
        "name": "enhancement",
        "color": "84b6eb",
        "url": "http://localhost:8080/api/v3/repos/root/gitbucket/labels/enhancement"
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
]
```

## Added plugin list API

A new API which returns the list of installed plugins has been added as `/api/v3/gitbucket/plugins` to make the [plugin build farm](https://github.com/kounoike/gitbucket-plugin-farm-test) in the future. This API has following response:

```javascript
[
  {
    "id": "maven-repository",
    "name": "Maven Repository Plugin",
    "version": "1.3.0",
    "description": "Host Maven repository on GitBucket.",
    "jarFileName": "gitbucket-maven-repository-plugin-assembly-1.3.0.jar"
  },
  {
    "id": "ci",
    "name": "CI Plugin",
    "version": "1.4.0",
    "description": "This plugin adds simple CI functionality to GitBucket.",
    "jarFileName": "gitbucket-ci-plugin-assembly-1.4.0.jar"
  }
]
```

As you can see, `versino` is typo of `version`, this is going to be fixed in the next release.

## Git authentication by personal access token

Personal access token can be used for Git authentication as an alternative to password of GitBucket account. It's recommended way more than use of password in the automated Git repository access for security reasons.

## CI plugin settings

An unofficial gitbucket-ci-plugin now allows to configure number of max parallel builds and max stored build history.

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fixes. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.23.0) to know details.

In particular, since `RELEASE` table has been renamed to `RELEASE_TAG` and also renamed an its model class, binary compatibility is broken in a lot of plugins. If you are a plugin author, please check whether your plugin works with GitBucket 4.23.0 and update if needed. If you are a plugin user and you found a binary compatibility issue, report the issue on the GitHub project of the plugin top let a plugin author know that.

Enjoy GitBucket!
