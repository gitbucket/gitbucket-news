Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git centric software development platform [GitBucket 4.27.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.27.0)!

## Create new tag on the browser

The repository viewer now supports creating new tag on the browser.

## EditorConfig support

[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) is a configuration format which helps to maintain consistent coding styles between various text editors and IDEs. GitBucket's online source code viewer and editor now support following configurations of EditorConfig when `.editorconfig` is at the root of a git repository:

- `indent_style`
- `indent_size` (`tab_width`)
- `end_of_line`

## Improve issues / pull requests search

Before this release, the search result of issues and pull requests were displayed on the same page, and we couldn't recognize which one is an issue or a pull request from displayed information. Now issues and pull requests were separated. Also their status (open or closed) is displayed on the list.

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fixes. Especially, plugin installation and pull request commenting have many improvements in this release. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.27.0) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
