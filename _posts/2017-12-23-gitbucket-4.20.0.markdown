GitBucket can't render a large diff on the browser. Even in this case, you can confirm complete diff by downloading a patch file and seing it.

## Quick pull request creation

If a repository has branches which can be raised as pull requests, buttons to create pull request are displayed on the top of the repository viewer. You can create pull request quickly using these buttons.

## Squash and rebase merge strategy for pull requests

You can choose merge strategy from following three options when you merge pull requests:

- Merge commit: Commits will be added to the base branch via a merge commit.
- Squash: Commits will be combined into one commit in the base branch.
- Rebase: Commits will be rebased and added to the base branch.

## Fork and create repository are proceeded asynchronously

In particular, forking large repositories were taking long time. So sometimes it was causing request timeout so far. In this release, fork and create repository became to be proceeded asynchronously to avoid request timeout.

## Create new repository by copying existing git repository

You can specify an existing git repository URL in the repository creation form. If the repository url has been specified, a new repository is created by copying the specified repository. All branches and tags are copied to a new repository.
