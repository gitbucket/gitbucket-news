## Notifications plugin

E-mail notification is separated as [gitbucket-notifications-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-notifications-plugin) and it's bundled with the GitBucket distribution. This plugin offers capability to turn onn / off e-mail notifications for each project or issue / pull request.

## Plugin hot deployment

You can install or uninstall plugins without rebooting GitBucket. You can install plugins by just putting a plugin jar file into `GITBUCKET_HOME/plugins`, and uninstall by removing a plugin jar file.
