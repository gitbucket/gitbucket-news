Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git centric software development platform [GitBucket 4.15.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.15.0)!

## Bundle GitBucket organization plugins

Following plugins are bundled with the GitBucket distribution (`gitbucket.war`). You can use these plugins in default. Of course, you can also disable these plugins in the administration console:

## Notifications plugin

E-mail notification is separated as [gitbucket-notifications-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-notifications-plugin) and it's bundled with the GitBucket distribution. This plugin offers capability to turn onn / off e-mail notifications for each project or issue / pull request.

## Plugin hot deployment

You can install or uninstall plugins without rebooting GitBucket. You can install plugins by just putting a plugin jar file into `GITBUCKET_HOME/plugins`, and uninstall by removing a plugin jar file.

Also `--plugin_dir` option has been added for plugin development. GitBucket can load plugins from a directory which is specified by this option. When you are developing a plugin, we recommend to run GitBucket as follows:

```
$ java -jar gitbucket.war --plugin_dir=<YOUR_PLUGIN_PROJECT_DIR>/target/scala-2.12
```

and run sbt to build your plugin as:

```
$ sbt ~package
```

Then sbt packages your plugin when you modify source code and GitBucket reloads it automatically. Copying a jar file to the plugin directory or restarting GitBucket is no longer necesarry to test your plugin.

## Markdown preview in comment editing forms

So far, new issue or comment forms were preview-able, but editing forms were just a textarea. In this release, these textareas became preview-able as well.

Enjoy GitBucket!
