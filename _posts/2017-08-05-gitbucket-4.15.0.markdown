Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git centric software development platform [GitBucket 4.15.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.15.0)!

## Bundle GitBucket organization plugins

Following plugins are bundled with the GitBucket distribution (`gitbucket.war`).

- [gitbucket-gist-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-gist-plugin)
- [gitbucket-emoji-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-emoji-plugin)
- [gitbucket-pages-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-pages-plugin)

These plugins can be enabled / disabled in the administration console:

## Notifications plugin

E-mail notification is separated as [gitbucket-notifications-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-notifications-plugin) and it's bundled with the GitBucket distribution. This plugin offers capability to turn onn / off e-mail notifications for each project or issue / pull request.

## Plugin hot deployment

You can install or uninstall plugins without rebooting GitBucket. You can install plugins by just putting a plugin jar file into `GITBUCKET_HOME/plugins`, and uninstall by removing a plugin jar file.

Also `--plugin_dir` option has been added for plugin development. GitBucket can load plugins from a directory which is specified by this option. When you are developing a plugin, we recommend to run GitBucket as follows:

```
$ java -jar gitbucket.war --plugin_dir=<YOUR_PLUGIN_PROJECT_DIR>/target/scala-2.12
```

and run sbt to build your plugin as:

```
$ sbt ~package
```

Then sbt packages your plugin when you modify source code and GitBucket reloads it automatically. Copying a jar file to the plugin directory or restarting GitBucket is no longer necesarry to test your plugin.

## Updated Slick to 3.2.1 from 3.2.0

Slick (a database access library used in GitBucket) is updated to 3.2.1 from 3.2.0.

**For plugin authors:** This version of Slick has no binary compatibility with a previous version, so many existing GitBucket plugins whould not work on GitBucket 4.15.0. Please update you plugins by rebuilding with GitBucket 4.15.0.

## Support ed25519 keys for SSH

ed25519 keys are now supported for git access via SSH.

## Markdown preview in comment editing forms

So far, new issue or comment forms were preview-able, but editing forms were just a textarea. In this release, these textareas became preview-able as well.
