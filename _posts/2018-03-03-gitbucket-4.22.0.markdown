## Update maven-repository-plugin

Unofficial [maven-repository-plugin](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket-maven-repository-plugin) has been updated. Now it's possible to create arbitary repositories on the administration console, and each repository can be configured in  whether artifaces are overwritable and whether repository is visible for all users. Invisible (private, in other words) repositories require basic authentication to access.

In addition, administrators can delete artifacts in repository on the web browser. This is available for even unoverwritable repositories.
