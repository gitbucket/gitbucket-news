Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git centric software development platform [GitBucket 4.25.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.25.0)!

## Security improvements

Previous versions of GitBucket have some security issues explained in [GitBucket 4.23.1 Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution](https://security.szurek.pl/gitbucket-unauthenticated-rce.html) by Kacper Szurek.

Already remote code execution vulnerability issue had been fixed in GitBucket 4.24.0, and also weakness of security token has been fixed in this release. Precended report from Kacper helped us to fix these issues quickly. Thanks for his work.

Futhermore, for more security improvement, PBKDF2 is used for password hashing instead of SHA-1 since this release.

## Show mail address at the profile page

User's Mail address can be displayed at the profile page. This can be turned on / off by system configuration.

## Expose user public keys

User publick keys are exposed at the new endpoint: `/{user}.keys`

## Download repository improvements

Downloading repository contents now has following new abilities:

- Includes LFS files as well
- Allows to download a specific directory
- Until now, the downloaded filename was like `{branch}.zip`. Now it contains a repository name and a directory name as `{repository}-{branch}-{directory}.zip`. (If you download a root directory, the filename is `{repository}-{branch}.zip`.)

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fixes. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.25.0) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
