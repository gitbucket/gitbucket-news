Nowadays, acquiring GitHub by Microsoft is making discussions about alternatives to GitHub and one contributor of GitBucket pointed [a topic at Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17241487). There was a comment which points out that not many of GitHub alternatives are eating their own dog food.

That's a reasonable pointing out.

There are some reasons in GitBucket isn't self-hosted. Money is one of them, but in my opinion, the biggest reason is the ease of contribution.

I guess that it's easier to work on GitHub than other platforms for contributors because most of our contributors already have GitHub account and they are used to GitHub. It motivates contributors and we can get a lot of feedbacks from them. Staying at GitHub makes both of us and users happy.

In addition, we use GitHub as a development platform of the open source project, but the main goal of GitBucket isn't to be that. It's made for in-house projects which are not able to use GitHub originally. So it's not fair to compare to GitHub as a development platform for open source projects.

I highly respect GitHub because I believe that they changed software development. I always enjoy development on it and GitBucket wouldn't have been born without it. GitBucket might be an alternative to GitHub, but it's not a competitor. Of course, I will keep to use GitHub for the GitBucket project in the future.

Thanks for GitHub as a great software development platform.
