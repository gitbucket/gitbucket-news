In addition, this release contains some important bug fixes like below:

- Possible InternalServerError in the pull request creating UI when you change selection of the target or source repository
- Possible StackOverflowError in the list of issues / pull requests at the dashboard if your account has a lot of repositories

If you are facing these problems, consider upgrading to the latest version of GitBucket. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.28.0) to know all updates in this release.
