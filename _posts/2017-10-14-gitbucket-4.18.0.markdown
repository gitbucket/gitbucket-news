## Commit hook plugins are applied to online editing

In previous versions, commit hooks (actually they are implemented as [ReceiveHook](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/blob/master/src/main/scala/gitbucket/core/plugin/ReceiveHook.scala)) which are supplied by plugins didn't work for online editing in the repository viewer. But they work in GitBucket 4.18.0.

It means the branch protection also works when we update files in the git repository on the browser.

## Improve gitbucket-ci-plugin

[gitbucket-ci-plugin](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket-ci-plugin) has been updated to 1.1.0 and it supports skip build by commit message and re-run build by pull request comment. Trigger words can be set at the build settings page as comma-separated values:

And following environment variables have been available in the build script:

- `CI` (true)
- `HOME` (root of the build directory)
- `CI_BUILD_DIR` (same as HOME)
- `CI_BUILD_NUMBER`
- `CI_BUILD_BRANCH`
- `CI_COMMIT_ID`
- `CI_COMMIT_MESSAGE`
- `CI_REPO_SLUG` ("owner/repo")
- `CI_PULL_REQUEST` (pull request id or "false")
- `CI_PULL_REQUEST_SLUG` ("owner/repo" or "")

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fix. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.18.0) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
