## Apply commit hook plugin to online editing

In previous versions, commit hooks which are supplied by plugins didn't work for online editing in the repository viewer. However, they work in GitBucket 4.18.0. Itmeans the branch protection also works when we update files in the git repository online.

## Improve gitbucket-ci-plugin

> TODO

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fix. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.18.0) to know details.
