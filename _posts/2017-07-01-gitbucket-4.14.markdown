## Web hook enhancement

This release includes following enhancement for web hook:

- Support gollum events (gollum events are events caused by Wiki operation)
- Support avvount (user / group) level web hook

## Add --max_file_size option

Added `--max_file_size` option to configure a max file size (bytes) in file uploading in standalone mode as:

```
java -jar gitbucket.war --max_file_size=10485760
```

Also it can be configured by a system property `gitbucket.maxFileSize`. If you are deployong GitBucket on the servlet container, you can configure this way.

## New extension points for plug-in

Added new extension points for plug-in to hook issue and pull request events:

- accountHooks
- issueHooks
- pullRequestHooks
- issueSidebars

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fix. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.14) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
