GitBucket has plugin system and there are a lot of useful plugins. Recently I found some new plugins which would really help the project management on GitBucket. I'd like to introduce them in this article.

## Kanban plugin

[https://github.com/kasancode/gitbucket-label-kanban-plugin](https://github.com/kasancode/gitbucket-label-kanban-plugin)

This plugin offers Kanban board for issues / pull requests. Columns are defined by special prefixed labels. It exploits existing GitBucket features well.

## Gantt plugin

[https://github.com/kasancode/gitbucket-gantt-plugin](https://github.com/kasancode/gitbucket-gantt-plugin)

This plugin was made by a same author of Kanban plugin. It visualizes the milestone (and issues / pull requests which are included in the milestone) progress as a gantt chart. It would help to grab the progress of the project.

## Excel plugin

and Excel!! This plugin makes possible to render Excel file on GitBucket. It really useful in some kind of projects which exploits Excel for any purposes.

This plugin being developing by a committer of GitBucket and it's not released yet. So we can't use it at the moment, but really cool. I can't wait for the release of this plugin.

Anyway, GitBucket has a lot of useful plugins in addition to the basic features. I hope you can find one which meets your requirement from them.

Enjoy GitBucket!
